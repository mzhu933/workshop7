##### This code implements a dynamic particle effect. Each frame randomly generates particles with different positions, sizes, and colors. At the same time, the particles will gradually shrink until they disappear. Through the superposition of transparent backgrounds, the picture retains the trajectory of the previous frame, forming an aesthetic effect similar to the floating fireflies in the night sky.

##### What makes me particularly satisfied is the randomness of the code's colors and the background's superposition. Each run will present a completely different picture. Despite this, there are still many areas where this code can be optimized, such as adding speed and direction to the particles to make them produce more complex motion trajectories or adding interactive functions, such as generating more particles by clicking the mouse and letting the particles move with the mouse. These improvements can further enhance the fun and immersion of the picture.

##### I plan to add dynamic background changes or more complex particle behaviors next and even integrate this effect into interactive visualization tools or mini-games to add more layers and practicality to this project.
